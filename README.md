# OMDB
Dispalying movies' data using omdb api.

For a search query, this project aims at displaying movies' data sorted by relevance by fetching it from OMDB API. It follows RESTful style of web development. ExpressJs is used for communicating with the server and getting the response from it in JSON format.ReactJs is then used for displaying the data. React components are used to take care of different portions of webpage.At max. this API shows 10 results only. For each movie, you can also get its full details as well by calling OMDB API with search query being that particular movie.

This web application can be used hosted as well. So i have deployed it using Amazon AWS service on my website. You can check it out on [freetimes](freetimes.xyz).
